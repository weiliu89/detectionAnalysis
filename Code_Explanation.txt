This contains updated instructions for version 2 of the analysis code.  You 
may also want to consult the README (created for version 1) and the pdf 
description, as well as the original paper:

"Diagnosing Error in Object Detectors", ECCV 2012.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main script is detectionAnalysisScript.  Full functionality applies to
only the VOC2007 dataset because detailed annotations are available only
on that dataset.  However, most functionality, including full false positive
analysis also applies to other VOC detection datasets.  The code has also 
been written to make it easy to adapt to other detection datasets that are
based on bounding box criteria.  It may be applicable to datasets for other
localization criteria, but more revision may be necessary.


MAIN FUNCTIONS

---- Functions that likely require editing ----

detectionAnalysisScript: Script for running all code.  
The first few lines  contain parameters specifying what analysis and display 
functions to call. The dataset type (e.g., 'VOC'), list of detectors to 
analyze, and list of object classes to analyze is also specified here. 

setDatasetParameters: Specifies specific datset (e.g., 
'VOC2007') and paths for images and annotations.  Some parameters are 
specific to the machine; others to the type of dataset.  The list of 
generally required parameters are explained in the function documentation.

setDetectorInfo: Specifies location of detection files
for each detector and directory to place results.


---- Functions that require editing if not using a VOC dataset ----

readDatasetAnnotations: For maximum compatibility (similar to say VOC2010), 
if using another dataset, this should produce the following structure:
  ann.
   rec(image_number).
     filename: name of image file 
     imgsize([w h]): width and height of image in pixels
     objects(num_objects).
        detailedannotation: true if detailed annotation is available 
          (probably false if not using VOC2007)
        details: annotations for visible parts, etc., if available, empty if not
        truncated: 0/1 for whether truncated
        difficult: 0/1 for whether this object is a don't care
   gt(object_class_number).     
     bbox(num_objects, [x1 y1 x2 y2]): ground truth bounding boxes
     rnum(num_objects): index into rec, specifying source image
     onum(num_objects): index into rec(rnum).objects, specifying which object
     isdiff(num_objects): whether each object is don't care
     istrunc(num_objects): whether each object is truncated
     isocc(num_objects): whether each object is occluded
     details(num_objects): detail structure if available (otherwise empty)
     N: number of ground truth objects
Note that isdiff, isocc, istrunc can be set to zeros if that information is 
not available; likewise trunacted and difficult in rec can be set to 0.

readDetections: Reads the output of the object detector.  For maximum 
compatibility, this should produce the following structure:
  det.
    bbox(ndetections, [x1 y1 x2 y2]): detection bounding box
    conf(ndetections): confidence for each detection (higher is more confident)
    rnum(ndetections): index into rec/gt structures, specifying source image
    nimages: total number of images in dataset
    N: total number of detections

If these functions can be written according to the above specifications
(which should be true for most bounding box based tasks), set dataset
in the main script to 'voc_compatible'.
    

---- Functions that may require editing if not using a VOC-compatible dataset ----

analyzeTrueDetections: Produces precision-recall curves and normalized PR
curves for objects with various characteristics.

matchDetectionsWithGroundTruth: Labels detections as incorrect, correct, or 
don't care.  localization parameter specifies whether localization error 
should be ignored ('weak') or not ('strong').  If you want to change the
localization criteria, edit setDatasetParameters and/or this function.  Also
assigned ground truth objects to detections with best score or overlap.

analyzeFalsePositives: Assigns detections to false positive types and
computes effects of each type of false positive.

displayPerCharacteristicPlots: Draws plots comparing normalized-AP for 
various object characteristics

displayAverageSensitivityImpactPlot: Averages across objects to show impact
of various object characteristics

writeMissedObjectCharacteristics: summarizes statistics for objects that are
not detected

displayGtConfidencePredictions: displays detected objects sorted by
the difference of predicted confidence (based on characteristics) and 
detection confidence (displays unexpectedly high confidence detections)

showSurprisingMisses: similar to above, but displays unexpectedly low
confidence detections

displayTopFP: displays and optionally saves most confident false positives

displayFalsePositiveImpactPlot: creates pie/bar charts for impact of 
false positives on performance

displayFPTrend: displays stacked area plots of false positive with 
increasing number of detections

writeFPAnalysisSummary: creates text file summarizing FP analysis

writeTexHeader: creates tex header file for creating pdf report

writeTexObject: creates tex material for results for one object category
